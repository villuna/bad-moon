# bad apple except it's moon emojis

I'm working on porting this to web, in which case you'll be able to see it by visiting my website. But if you want to see it now then

1) Make sure you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed
2) Make sure you have [some ffmpeg dependencies](https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg/wiki/Notes-on-building) installed
3) Make sure your terminal emulator can render emojis
4) `cargo run -r` and enjoy :)
