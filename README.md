# bad apple except it's moon emojis

I've written two versions of this - one written in JavaScript that runs in your browser, and one written in rust that runs in the terminal.

## How to run

### Rust version

1) Make sure you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed
2) Make sure you have [some ffmpeg dependencies](https://github.com/zmwangx/rust-ffmpeg/wiki/Notes-on-building) installed
3) Make sure your terminal emulator can render emojis
4) `cargo run -r` and enjoy :)

### Javascript version

Just spin up a basic dev server and it should just work. Alternatively I'm going to try put it on my website so when I do I'll put a link here :)
